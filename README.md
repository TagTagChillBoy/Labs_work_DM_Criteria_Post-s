Post's_Criteria.py - Implementation of Post's completeness criterion for checking whether a system of Boolean functions is functionally complete.

Schaeffer's_Stroke.py - The solution to the Schaeffer Stroke problem is to construct a representation of a Boolean function only through the Schaeffer operator (AND—NOT) based on the truth table. The algorithm implements the SDNF transformation method using recursive functions.

Zhegalkin's_Polynom.py - The solution to the Zhegalkin Polynomial problem is the construction of the Zhegalkin polynomial for a Boolean function based on its truth table. The algorithm uses the triangle method (Mobius transform) to calculate the coefficients.
